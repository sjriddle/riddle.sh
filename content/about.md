Hello! I'm Sam Riddle, a seasoned developer, architect, and leader with over a decade of 
experience in developing high-quality software solutions and implementing streamlined development operations. 
I specialize in delivering technical solutions that drive business performance and scalability, primarily to 
consulting businesses of various sizes and sectors.

Over the years, I've gained substantial knowledge in modern development languages, frameworks, and operational tools. 
These engineering skills have enabled me to deliver robust, maintainable, and scalable software solutions. In addition,
cloud technologies like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform have allowed me to architect and implement highly 
available, fault-tolerant, and scalable infrastructure.

Throughout my career, I've always believed in the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new technologies. 
I'm always up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices, which helps me provide top-notch services 
to my clients. Iâ€™m an advocate for open-source technologies, further fostering my passion for knowledge sharing and 
community engagement.

At my core, I am a problem-solver and always strive to turn complex problems into simple, efficient solutions. 
My goal is to help businesses achieve their full potential by leveraging the right mix of software solutions 
and operational strategies.

I currently offer technical consulting in the following areas of engineering and development:
 - `DevOps Engineering`
 - `Full-Stack Development`
 - `Cloud Solutions Architecture`
 - `Infrastructure Development`
 - `Blockchain Engineering`
 - `Smart Contract Development`
 - `Data Engineering`

If you're looking for a dedicated professional who can bring your vision to life while ensuring a smooth and efficient
software development process, feel free to get in touch. I look forward to bringing value to your business and together,
we can build software that drives your success.
